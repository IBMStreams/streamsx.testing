# Examples for testing SPL Composites

In this example, we have the following projects:

* com.ibm.streamsx.testing.app - This contains the SPL composite under test as well as the main composite for an application.
* com.ibm.streamsx.testing.spl - This contains the SPL composite for testing
* com.ibm.streamsx.testing.java - This project demonstrates how clients can test SPL composites using Java Application API and the JUnit framework
* com.ibm.streamsx.testing.pythonn - This project demonstrates how clients can test SPL composites using the Python Application API and the Python unittest framework
